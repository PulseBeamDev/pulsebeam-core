## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**Keep your API credentials secure!**

- The `<API_KEY>` and `<API_SECRET>` are sensitive credentials that grant access to your application‚Äôs PulseBeam resources. **Do not expose these credentials** in:
  - Public repositories.
  - Client-side code.
  - Shared or unencrypted environments.

- Treat tokens generated by this CLI as sensitive data. Tokens should only be shared with trusted clients.

### Recommended Practices:
1. **Environment Variables:** Store your API credentials securely in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your codebase.
    ```bash
    export PULSEBEAM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export PULSEBEAM_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
    ```

2. **Access Controls:** Regularly rotate API credentials and limit their scope to only necessary permissions.

3. **Auditing:** Monitor usage of your credentials and investigate any unauthorized activity.

## üí≥ Billing and Token Usage

**Be aware:** Generating and using tokens can incur billing charges. Each token enables interactions with PulseBeam's infrastructure, which may contribute to your account‚Äôs usage costs.

### Billing Best Practices:
1. **Understand Your Plan:** Familiarize yourself with the details of your billing plan. For more information, visit our [Billing Page](https://pulsebeam.dev/billing).
2. **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of token usage to avoid unexpected charges. Utilize PulseBeam‚Äôs dashboards and APIs for real-time monitoring.
3. **Token Expiration:** Set appropriate `duration` values for tokens to limit unnecessary usage. Tokens with a longer duration may result in increased billing if misused.
4. **Audit Token Distribution:** Ensure tokens are only distributed to trusted clients to avoid misuse that could drive up costs.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Billing Warning

- Tokens allow access to PulseBeam's infrastructure and **may result in charges depending on your usage**.
- Misuse or unauthorized distribution of tokens can lead to **unexpected billing costs**.
- **Ensure you monitor your account's activity regularly** and revoke tokens that are no longer needed.
